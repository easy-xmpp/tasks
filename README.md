Tasks
=====

This repository is a centralized collection of tasks which need to be done in the realm of [Easy XMPP](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Easy_XMPP). The only relevant part of this project is [the issue tracker](https://github.com/easy-xmpp/tasks/issues).

Guidelines
----------

* If adding a tasks for a specific software project, either add the ``needs-upstream-issue`` label, file an upstream issue and link it right away, or explain why an upstream issue is not needed or wanted. We do not want to make tasks harder to follow by detracting conversations and comments away from the places where the change needs to happen.
